<body><div class="democontent">Tawny Owl</a> (Strix aluco) is a stocky, medium-sized owl which is common in woodlands across much of Eurasia. Its underparts are pale with dark streaks, and the upperparts are brown or grey.</p><p>The nest is typically in a tree hole, and eggs and young are fiercely defended against predators. This owl is non-migratory and highly territorial, and many young starve if they cannot find a vacant territory once parental care ceases.</p><p class="note">Image credit: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tawny_wiki_edit1.jpg">K.-M.
